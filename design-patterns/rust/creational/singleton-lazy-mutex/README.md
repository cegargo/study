# Singleton Pattern


## Overview
From Wikipedia:
```
In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern
that restricts the instantiation of a class to a singular instance. One of
the well-known "Gang of Four" design patterns, which describe how to solve
recurring problems in object-oriented software, the pattern is useful when
exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

More specifically, the singleton pattern allows objects to:

    Ensure they only have one instance
    Provide easy access to that instance
    Control their instantiation (for example, hiding the constructors of a
    class)

The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.
